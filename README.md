# Bridge Tokens — BridgeUSDT & BridgeBNB

Two bridged (wrapped) ERC20 tokens built on OpenZeppelin Contracts 5.x, where the
deployer is the admin and can mint and burn.

| Contract     | Name        | Symbol | Decimals |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| `BridgeUSDT` | Bridge USDT | `USDT` | 18       |
| `BridgeBNB`  | Bridge BNB  | `BNB`  | 18       |

Both inherit everything from `contracts/token/BridgeToken.sol`; the child contracts
only fix the name, symbol and decimals.

## What the tokens do

Built from OpenZeppelin `ERC20`, `ERC20Burnable`, `ERC20Pausable`, `ERC20Permit`
and `AccessControl`:

- **Mint** — `mint(to, amount)` and `mintBatch(recipients[], amounts[])`, gated on `MINTER_ROLE`.
- **Burn** — `adminBurn(from, amount)` destroys any account's balance with no allowance, gated on `BURNER_ROLE`.
- **Holder burn** — the standard `burn(amount)` and `burnFrom(owner, amount)` stay allowance-based, so holders can exit the bridge themselves.
- **Pause** — `pause()` / `unpause()` freeze all transfers, mints and burns, gated on `PAUSER_ROLE`.
- **Permit** — EIP-2612 gasless approvals.
- **Rescue** — `rescueERC20(token, to, amount)` sweeps tokens sent to the contract by mistake, gated on `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

### Roles

The address you pass to the constructor receives all four roles at deployment:

| Role                 | Can do                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` | Grant/revoke every role, call `rescueERC20`       |
| `MINTER_ROLE`        | `mint`, `mintBatch`                               |
| `BURNER_ROLE`        | `adminBurn` on any account                        |
| `PAUSER_ROLE`        | `pause`, `unpause`                                |

Because roles are separable, you can keep `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` on your own wallet
and later grant `MINTER_ROLE` / `BURNER_ROLE` to the bridge relayer contract:

```solidity
token.grantRole(token.MINTER_ROLE(), bridgeRelayer);
token.revokeRole(token.MINTER_ROLE(), myOldWallet);
```

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # then fill it in
npm run build
npm test
```

Requires Node 22+. Tested here on Node 24 / Windows.

For a key that controls real value, use the encrypted keystore rather than a
plaintext `.env`:

```bash
npx hardhat keystore set DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

## Deploy

Contracts are grouped by folder under `contracts/`, and each folder has one Ignition
module of the same name in `ignition/modules/`. You deploy one group at a time with
`--sc`:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --sc token   --network nurachain   # only contracts/token
npx hardhat deploy --sc airdrop --network nurachain   # only contracts/airdrop
```

Or through npm:

```bash
npm run deploy:nurachain:token
npm run deploy:nurachain:airdrop

# equivalent, passing the flag through npm — note the extra --
npm run deploy:nurachain -- --sc token
```

> `npm run deploy:nurachain --sc token` (without the `--`) does **not** work. npm 11
> parses `--sc` as an abbreviation of its own `--scope` config and drops it, so the
> flag never reaches Hardhat. The `--` is what forwards it.

Adding a new group is two steps: create `contracts/<name>/`, add
`ignition/modules/<name>.ts`, then add `"<name>"` to the `DEPLOYABLE` list at the top
of `hardhat.config.ts`. `--sc` validates against that list and errors with the valid
choices if you mistype it.

`--reset` wipes a module's previous deployment state before redeploying:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --sc airdrop --network nurachain --reset
```

### The airdrop asks before it deploys

`--sc airdrop` has two values it will not guess for you, and stops to ask:

```
contracts/airdrop needs a claim cap and a per-claim reward. The cap is immutable
once deployed, so neither has a default — answer, or re-run with --max-claims
and --reward.

  Maximum number of claims: 50000
  Reward per claim, in NURA: 200

  Cap:    50,000 claims (immutable)
  Reward: 200 NURA per claim
  Pool:   10,000,000 NURA to cover every claim, sent to the
          deployed address afterwards — this module does not fund it.
```

`maxClaims` is `immutable` in the contract — there is no setter, no upgrade, no second
chance — and the two together decide how much coin you are committing to fund. That is
why neither has a default: the wrong number here is not a number you get to change.

Answer at the prompt, or supply them up front and skip the questions:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --sc airdrop --network nurachain --max-claims 50000 --reward 200
```

`--reward` is in whole coin, not wei. Both are also read from the parameters file
below, and anything found there is not asked about. A run with no terminal to ask on —
CI, a piped shell — fails with that message rather than deploying a guess.

### Deploy parameters

Both modules default the admin to the deploying account. To override, create
`ignition/params.json` (gitignored) keyed by module name:

```json
{
  "token":   { "admin": "0xYourMultisig" },
  "airdrop": {
    "admin":  "0xYourMultisig",
    "signer": "0xYourBackendSignerAddress",
    "maxClaims": "50000n",
    "rewardAmount": "200000000000000000000n"
  }
}
```

then pass it:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --sc airdrop --network nurachain --parameters ./ignition/params.json
```

`maxClaims` and `rewardAmount` there are optional — include them to deploy without
being asked, leave them out to answer at the prompt. Unlike `--reward`, `rewardAmount`
in this file is in **wei**, in Ignition's `"<digits>n"` spelling for bigints. `--max-claims`
and `--reward` win over the file if you pass both.

### Verify on BscScan

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network bsc <deployedAddress> <adminAddress>
```

## Deploying to Nurachain

Nurachain is not in any public chain registry, so its RPC URL and chain ID have to
come from Nurachain's own docs and go in your `.env`:

```bash
NURACHAIN_RPC_URL=https://...
NURACHAIN_CHAIN_ID=...
```

The `nurachain` network is already defined in `hardhat.config.ts` and reads both.
Then:

```bash
# 1. Check the RPC, chain id, balance, and that the bytecode runs there
npm run preflight:nurachain

# 2. Deploy both tokens
npm run deploy:nurachain
```

Run the preflight first. It estimates deployment gas against the actual node, which
executes the constructor — so if Nurachain does not support the Cancun opcodes this
build targets, it fails there instead of after you have spent gas on a reverted
deploy. It also refuses to continue if the deployer cannot cover the cost.

**If preflight fails on opcodes**, the fix is to drop to an older OpenZeppelin that
does not use `mcopy` (5.1.x) and set `evmVersion: "paris"` in `hardhat.config.ts`.
Ask and I'll do that downgrade.

**Fund the deployer first** with Nurachain's native gas token — the deployer is
whatever address `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` corresponds to, and preflight prints it.

**Verification** depends on what explorer Nurachain runs. If it is Blockscout, add
this to `hardhat.config.ts` and run `npx hardhat verify --network nurachain <address> <admin>`:

```ts
verify: {
  blockscout: { enabled: true },
},
```

If it is an Etherscan-style explorer, it needs its own API key and URL entry instead.
Many small chains support neither, in which case you verify by pasting the flattened
source into their explorer UI — `npx hardhat flatten contracts/token/BridgeUSDT.sol > flat.sol`.

## The airdrop

`contracts/airdrop/Airdrop.sol` pays a fixed amount of native NURA to the first N
eligible addresses that call `getReward`. One claim per address, ever. The amount and
the cap are chosen at deploy time — see [the prompts above](#the-airdrop-asks-before-it-deploys);
the worked examples below use 200 NURA and 50,000 claims.

Eligibility is proven with an EIP-712 signature from a backend key holding
`SIGNER_ROLE`. That is doing the real work: "one claim per address" on its own is
worthless, because anyone can generate unlimited addresses and take every slot. The
signature is what decides who is eligible; the on-chain checks only stop double claims
and cap overruns.

| Function | Who | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getReward(deadline, signature)` | anyone with a valid signature | Claims `rewardAmount` once |
| `fund()` / plain transfer | anyone | Adds to the payout pool |
| `setRewardAmount(uint256)` | `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` | Changes the reward for *future* claims |
| `withdraw(to, amount)` | `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` | Recovers leftover NURA |
| `pause()` / `unpause()` | `PAUSER_ROLE` | Halts claiming |

Views: `remainingClaims()`, `fundedClaims()`, `outstandingLiability()`, `hasClaimed(address)`,
and `claimDigest(account, deadline)` for debugging signatures.

### Funding it

The contract pays from its own native balance, so **deploying is not enough**. Covering
every claim needs `maxClaims * rewardAmount` sent to the deployed address — 10,000,000
NURA at 50,000 x 200. The deploy prints that figure once you have answered. It pays out
until the balance runs dry, then reverts with `InsufficientBalance` — so you can start
partially funded and top up as you go.

### Backend signing

Your server signs an approval per eligible address. The signing key must hold
`SIGNER_ROLE`:

```ts
import { Wallet } from "ethers";

const signer = new Wallet(process.env.AIRDROP_SIGNER_KEY!);

const domain = {
  name: "Airdrop",
  version: "1",
  chainId: 1020,                  // Nurachain
  verifyingContract: AIRDROP_ADDRESS,
};

const types = {
  Claim: [
    { name: "account", type: "address" },
    { name: "deadline", type: "uint256" },
  ],
};

// deadline is a unix timestamp; the signature is unusable after it
const deadline = BigInt(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 24 * 3600);
const signature = await signer.signTypedData(domain, types, { account, deadline });

// hand { deadline, signature } to the frontend; the user calls:
//   airdrop.getReward(deadline, signature)
```

The domain binds each signature to this contract on this chain, so one cannot be
replayed against another deployment or a fork. Rotate the key any time with
`grantRole(SIGNER_ROLE, newKey)` / `revokeRole(SIGNER_ROLE, oldKey)` — in-flight
signatures from the old key stop working immediately.

### Airdrop caveats

- **The signer key is the whole security model.** Anyone who steals it can sign
  themselves as many claims as the cap allows and drain the entire pool. Keep it off the
  deployer machine, and prefer a separate key from `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
- **`maxClaims` is immutable.** It is set once, in the constructor, from what you answer
  at deploy time. Getting it wrong means redeploying and re-pointing everything at the
  new address.
- **`setRewardAmount` is not retroactive.** Lowering it after 10,000 people claimed
  does not claw anything back.
- **Claimers pay their own gas.** They need a small NURA balance before they can claim,
  which is awkward if the airdrop is meant to be someone's first NURA. If you need
  gasless claiming, that is a relayer/meta-transaction change — ask and I'll add it.

## Notes before you put real value behind this

- **The tokens are only as good as the backing.** Nothing on-chain enforces that
  minted supply matches assets locked on the source chain. A minter can create
  unbacked supply at will. That trust sits entirely with whoever holds `MINTER_ROLE`.
- **`adminBurn` can destroy anyone's balance** and `pause` can freeze the token.
  Those are intentional operator powers, but they are also what an attacker gets if
  your admin key leaks. Move the roles to a multisig — and ideally a timelock — before
  the token holds meaningful value.
- **No replay protection on mints.** If a relayer submits the same source-chain
  deposit twice, it mints twice. Either make the relayer idempotent off-chain, or add
  a `mapping(bytes32 => bool) processed` keyed by source tx hash to `mint`. Ask if you
  want that added.
- **`BridgeUSDT` uses 18 decimals** to match USDT on BNB Chain. USDT on Ethereum and
  Tron uses 6 — bridging from either means the relayer must scale amounts by `1e12`.
- **EVM target is `cancun`.** OpenZeppelin 5.6 uses the `mcopy` opcode, so the build
  cannot target `paris`. BNB Chain supports Cancun; check any other target chain first.
- **Not audited.**
